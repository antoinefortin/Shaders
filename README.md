# Hello!
This is a repo of shaders I made with custom pipeline, Unity and Unreal. See this repo as an openspace where I share idea of shaders and explore algorithms
It's a sandbox, where you can find graph, ray-marching, ray-tracing, Unreal, Unity, OpenGL, HLSL and whatsoever. With love and passion.
